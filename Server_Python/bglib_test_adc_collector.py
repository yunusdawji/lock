BASIC ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW:
    The program starts, initializes the dongle to a known state, then starts
    scanning. Each time an advertisement packet is found, a scan response
    event packet is generated. These packets are read by polling the serial
    port to which the BLE(D)11x is attached.
    
    The basic process is as follows:
      a. Scan for devices
      b. If the desired UUID is found in an ad packet, connect to that device
      c. Search for all "service" descriptors to find the target service handle range
      d. Search through the target service to find the ADC measurement attribute handle
      e. Enable notifications on the ADC measurement attribute
      f. Read and display incoming ADC values until terminating (Ctrl+C)

FUNCTION ANALYSIS:

1. __main__:
    Initializes the serial port and BGLib object to attach event handlers,
    then sends commands to cause the device to disconnect, stop advertising,
    and stop scanning (i.e. return to a known idle/standby state). Some of
    these commands will fail since the device cannot be doing all of these
    things at the same time, but this is not a problem. __main__ finishes
    by setting scan parameters and initiating a scan with the "gap_discover"
    command.

2. my_ble_evt_gap_scan_response:
    Raised during scanning whenever an advertisement packet is detected. The
    data provided includes the MAC address, RSSI, and ad packet data payload.
    This payload includes fields which contain any services being advertised,
    which allows us to scan for a specific service. In this demo, the service
    we are searching for has a custom 128-bit UUID which is contained in the
    "uuid_adc_measurement_service" variable. Once a match is found, the script
    initiates a connection request with the "gap_connect_direct" command.

3. my_ble_evt_connection_status
    Raised when the connection status is updated. This happens when the
    connection is first established, and the "flags" byte will contain 0x05 in
    this instance. However, it will also happen if the connected devices bond
    (i.e. pair), or if encryption is enabled (e.g. with "sm_encrypt_start").
    Once a connection is established, the script begins a service discovery
    with the "attclient_read_by_group_type" command.

4. my_ble_evt_attclient_group_found
    Raised for each group found during the search started in #3. If the right
    service is found (matched by UUID), then its start/end handle values are
    stored for usage later. We cannot use them immediately because the ongoing
    read-by-group-type procedure must finish first.

5. my_ble_evt_attclient_find_information_found
    Raised for each attribute found during the search started after the service
    search completes. We look for two specific attributes during this process;
    the first is the unique ADC measurement attribute which has a proprietary
    128-bit UUID (contained in the "uuid_adc_measurement_characteristic"
    variable), and the second is the corresponding "client characteristic
    configuration" attribute with a UUID of 0x2902. The correct attribute here
    will always be the first 0x2902 attribute after the measurement attribute
    in question. Typically the CCC handle value will be either +1 or +2 from
    the original handle.

6. my_ble_evt_attclient_procedure_completed
    Raised when an attribute client procedure finishes, which in this script
    means when the "attclient_read_by_group_type" (service search) or the
    "attclient_find_information" (descriptor search) completes. Since both
    processes terminate with this same event, we must keep track of the state
    so we know which one has actually just finished. The completion of the
    service search will (assuming the service is found) trigger the start of
    the descriptor search, and the completion of the descriptor search will
    (assuming the attributes are found) trigger enabling notifications on
    the measurement characteristic.

7. my_ble_evt_attclient_attribute_value
    Raised each time the remote device pushes new data via notifications or
    indications. (Notifications and indications are basically the same, except
    that indications are acknowledged while notifications are not--like TCP vs.
    UDP.) In this script, the remote slave device pushes ADC measurements out
    as fast as possible, and each of the 8 channels is displayed here to the
    console as a signed 12-bit integer, which is the format in which it comes
    directly from the ADC. A value of 0 indicates GND-level voltage, and a
    value of +2047 indicates VDD-level voltage. The GND-level reading may wrap
    slightly into negative numbers; this is normal and does not indicate a
    problem.
